                        Direct detection of observables is not possible, therefore ground-based or extraterrestrial indirect measurement processes are used.
                        In order to extract physical measurements from the measured observables, it is necessary to calibrate the system using data where the truth is known (for example, simulation data).

                        Astrophysical sources accelerate different kinds of particles like nuclei, gammas or leptons.
                        On their way to the detector they can be deflected by magnetic fields, interact with dust or gas clouds or be absorbed or deflected by compact objects.
                        Detections can be performed extraterrestrially in a limited energy range and otherwise ground-based.

                        Depending on the initial particle type,

                        The shower regions can be subdivided into three
                        different components, the electromagnetic (em), muonic and
                        hadronic component.
                        Shown are a proton-induced and an electron-induced shower
                        with an initial particle energy of $1\,\mathrm{PeV}$ using the most
                        complete model currently available in CORSIKA8.
                        The most obvious difference is the number of hadrons
                        and muons produced.
                        For electron or gamma induced showers,
                        the production of muons or hadronic particles is a
                        subdominant process.
                        It is currently missing in the em description and will be added in the near future.
                        Due to the higher radiation losses for em processes,
                        these are more compact and have a smaller deviation from
                        the shower core (lateral distribution).

                                    Electrons and photons deposit their loss

                                    further photons, electrons and positrons.
                                    Their radiation length is much smaller than that of muons, so their range is much smaller.
                                    High-energy particles usually do not have
                                    any significant deviation from the shower

                                    In hadronic as well as electromagnetic processes muons or particles can be produced which decay to muons.
                                    The dominant process is the production by hadronic interactions of charged pions which decays by a leptonic decay into a muon.
                                    \begin{equation}
                                    \pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu_\mu
                                    \end{equation}
                                    There is also a chance to produce muons via electromagnetic processes like
                                    \begin{equation}
                                    e^- + \ce{Z} \rightarrow e^- + \ce{Z} + \mu^+ + \mu^-
                                    \end{equation}
                                    or inelastic interactions with the nucleus.
                                    </p>

                                    If a nucleus interacts it produces a hughe
                                    number of mesons.
                                    The heavier mesons like the Kaon can decay
                                    in lighter mesons like the pion.
                                    \begin{equation}
                                    K^+ \rightarrow \pi^+ + \pi^0
                                    \end{equation}
                                    The neutral pions subsequently generate an
                                    electromagnetic component.
                                    \begin{equation}
                                    \pi^0 \rightarrow \gamma +\gamma

                        For the use of a library in different application cases
                        it is advantageous to use a package manager.
                        For this purpose, the possibility to create
                        packages that can be used by other users was etablished.
                        Through versioning, functions can be added more
                        transparently and simulation situations can be recreated.

                        <p class="text-intro">
                        Interactions in PROPOSAL are usually calculated on the basis of differential cross-sections.
                        The rates can be calculated by integration over the physical kinematic limits.
                        Some of them diverge so that a threshold is necessary below which losses aren't handled continuously.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        The available effective cross sections in PROPOSAL are usually differentially parameterised in the relative energy loss $\nu$.
                        Rates are calculated by integration over the parametrisation kinematic limits.
                        To avoid multiple integrations, two dimensional interpolants can be used in $(\nu, E)$.
                        </p>

                        \begin{equation}
                        \sigma_\mathrm{tot} = \int_{\nu_{\min}}^{\nu_{\max}} \frac{\mathrm{d}\sigma(E)}{\mathrm{d} \nu} \, \mathrm{d}\nu
                        \end{equation}

                        <p>
                        Some of the electromagnetic cross sections diverge for small relative energy transfers $\nu \rightarrow \nu_{\min}$.
                        An example is the bremsstrahlung radiation cross section which is shown below.

                        Purposefully, a relative loss cut $\nu_\mathrm{cut}(E)$ is introduced below which processes are no longer considered stochastically.
                        However, they can still be considered as continuous energy loss.

                        Below an energy threshold, it is not feasible to stochastically resolve all losses.
                        Instead, they are combined into an averaged ensemble.

                        covered by the em module in CORSIKA.
                        For this purpose, based on the particle condition
                        $q_i$ the maximum energy at which a decay $E_\mathrm{d}$,
                        the next stochastic interaction $E_\mathrm{i}$,
                        or a condition $E_\mathrm{c}$ is fullfilled, is
                        calculated.
                        A condition can be for example the maximum continuous
                        energy loss or a maximum distance.
                        The particle is moved to the position of maximum energy
                        and if the condition or decay energy is maximum,
                        the propagator terminates.
                        After that it is possible to calculate the decay spectrum
                        of the lepton if it is of interest.
                        Based on the state before $q_i$ and after the continuous loss
                        $q_\mathrm{CL}$ the effect of elastic Coulomb scattering

                        and an interaction and a loss are sampled.
                        The directional deflection due to the interaction can be
                        taken into account on the state of the primary particle
                        after the stochastic loss $q_\mathrm{Inter}$ as a
                        direction correction.
                        The state $q_\mathrm{inter}$ forms the
                        intial state $q_{i+1}$ of the next propagation step.

                        For energies going towards the stochastic energy threshold, the acceptance probability decreases, since the change of the mean free path is large.
                        The allowable step size through the maximum continuous
                        loss is the dominant effect at low particle energies, suppressing the effect.

                        of the maximum continuous energy loss (dashed line) of 10 %.
                        This leads to the fact that the step size is much smaller
                        than necessary for the description of the stochastic process (solid line).

                        The interpolation is restricted to an interval on which
                        the function is strictly monotonic.
                        The nodes are distributed according to a known invertible
                        distribution, so no interval nesting needs to be used.

                        For study purposes, $50$ inital $10\,\mathrm{TeV}$ electron showers were simulated.
                        The $68\,\%$-quantiles are plotted as the error bar and not the
                        error on the mean value.
                        The lateral profiles can be used to check whether the production mechanisms
                        and the continuous losses of the particles look reasonable.

                        <p>
                        Based on the lateral profile, physical measurements can
                        be extracted, such as the charge excess.

                        <p>
                        By varying the initial particle energy,
                        the $X_{\max}$ distribution can be fitted.
                        This is a measurement which is relevant for a variety of
                        experiments.
